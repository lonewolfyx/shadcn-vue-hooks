# Shadcn Vue Hooks

A comprehensive collection of reusable Vue composables designed specifically for the shadcn-vue ecosystem. This project provides production-ready hooks that solve common development challenges and enhance your Vue applications with powerful, type-safe utilities.

## What is shadcn-vue-hooks?

**shadcn-vue-hooks** is a curated library of Vue 3 composables that extend the functionality of shadcn-vue components. Built on top of modern Vue 3 Composition API and TypeScript, these hooks provide reusable logic for common patterns in component development, state management, and user interactions.

### Key Features

- **🎯 Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **🔧 Reusable**: Modular design allows you to use only what you need
- **📦 Easy Installation**: Install individual hooks via `shadcn-vue add` command
- **🚀 Modern Architecture**: Built on Vue 3 Composition API

## Available Hooks

| Hook Name | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **createContext** | ✅ Available | Type-safe context management for Vue applications. Solves prop drilling issues with a clean, injectable pattern. |
| **useForwardPropsEmits** | 🚧 In Development | Efficiently forward props and emits to child components while maintaining type safety. |
| **useForwardProps** | 🚧 In Development | Smart props forwarding with automatic filtering and optimization. |
| **useEmitAsProps** | 🚧 In Development | Convert event handlers into props for seamless component composition. |
| **useForwardExpose** | 🚧 In Development | Forward component exposes for better composition patterns. |
| **useIsMac** | 🚧 In Development | Detect if the user is running on macOS for platform-specific behavior. |

### Legend
- ✅ **Available**: Ready for production use with full documentation
- 🚧 **In Development**: Planned hooks under active development

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a working Vue 3 project with shadcn-vue installed:

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest init
```

### Installing Hooks

Add our custom registry to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@shadcn-vue-hooks": "https://shadcn-vue-hooks.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Then install individual hooks:

```bash
# Install the context management hook
npx shadcn-vue@latest add @shadcn-vue-hooks/createContext

# Install other hooks as they become available
npx shadcn-vue@latest add @shadcn-vue-hooks/useForwardPropsEmits
```

### Basic Usage

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="toggleTheme">
      Current Theme: {{ config.theme }}
    </button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { injectConfigContext } from '@/composables/createContext'

const config = injectConfigContext()

const toggleTheme = () => {
  // Implementation logic here
}
</script>
```
